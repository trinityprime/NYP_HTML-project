      <h1 id="title"><strong>A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO LEAGUE OF LEGENDS</strong></h1>
      <p>Are you a new player who has just downloaded the game? <br> Are you a veteran who needs to refresh their memory
        about the game? <br> Or do you just find the game too daunting? <br> If you answered yes to any of the
        questions, then this guide is for you!</p>
      <h4>This guide will be covering the following topics:</h4>
      <p>1. What <em>is</em> league of legends?</p>
      <p>2. How do I pilot my character?</p>
      <p>3. Role assignments</p>
      <p>4. What do I do during the game?</p>
      <p>5. What does gold do?</p>
      <p>6. What are runes? Summoner spells?</p>
      <p>7. How do I get better in general?</p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>1. What <em>is</em> league of legends?</h4>
      <p>League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy
        the others enemy nexus, nexus basically referring to the core, which when destroyed, ends the game.</p>
      <img src="images/mapnexus.jpg" height="500" width="1000" />
      <p>Here is a map of the game, with blue side (blue circle) and red side (red circled) highlighted. At the start of
        the game, you and 4 other teammates will spawn at either nexus.</p>
      <p>In order to clear a path to the nexus, you will have to destroy the towers standing in you and your allies'
        way. Minions will spawn on both sides, which would help you destroy these towers and eventually the nexus as
        well. </p>
      <p>You begin at level 1 and gradually get stronger throughout the game by gaining experience and earning gold to
        buy items.
      <p>Your team and the enemy team will continually grow in power and collide. Eventually, one team is able to get
        the upper hand and make a final push for a victory.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>2. How do I pilot my character?</h4>
      <p>Every champion has auto-attacks and abilities at their disposal. Auto-attacks, also known as “basic attacks”
        occur when a player right clicks on a target, continuing until it dies. Abilities are cast using Q, W, E, and R.
        Every champion has abilities that are unique to them for each of these buttons. Here is Xayahs ultimate
        "Featherstorm", in action below (1st gif), as well as Aphelios using multiple abilites below (2nd gif)</p>

      <div>
        <img src="media/xayahult.gif" id="xayah" />
        <img src="media/aphel.gif" id="aphel" width="600" height="350" />
        <p>A major aspect that sets champions apart is the distribution of their stats. Stats represent a champions make
          up as far as how hard they are to kill, how much damage they do, and how fast they move or attack.</p>

        <div class="stats">
          <img src="images/healthmana.jpeg" id="healthmana" width="600" height="250" />
          <img src="images/levleip.jpg" id="level" width="603" height="250" />
        </div>


        <div>
          <p>In the image above, the yellow bar represents your own health, the blue bar your allies' health, and the
            red bar your enemies' health. Most champions have a mana bar (blue bar below the health bar) which can be
            replenished at the spawn point, as well as in battle (albeit more slowly)</p>
          <p>Different champions have different stats, and as you level up, you gain more health, mana, and can level up
            your abilities</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>3. Role assignments</h4>
          <p>In a standard game of League of Legends, each of the five players on a team is assigned to one of the five
            specific roles. The five roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC (Attack damage carry), and Support.</p>
          <p>Before a match, you have the opportunity to select a primary role which indicates the role youd prefer to
            play, as well as a secondary role which represents a backup choice.</p>
          <img src="images/map2.png" id="map2" height="500" width="800" />
          <p>I will give a brief description of all 5 roles in league of legends, so see which one you prefer the most,
            or just go ahead and try them all!</p>

        <h4>4. What do I do during the game?</h4>
        <p>These concepts are leaning more towards being intermediate than beginner, but I want to quickly go over them
          since you will likely hear the terminology of the three phases: early game, mid game, and late game.</p>
        <p>The phases arent set in stone and act more as guidelines as every game is different in its own way, but they
          tend to hold true to regarding how the majority of games turn out:</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Early game (the first 15 minutes)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is when all the turrets are up and everyone is in their lane except for the junglers.</p>
        <p>Until the jungler arrives, top and mid will mostly be 1v1 and bot lane will mostly be 2v2.</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Mid game (15 to 30 minutes)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>At around 15 minutes, or when the first turrets begin to be destroyed, the mid game begins.</p>
        <p>During the mid game, a match becomes messier than lane phase as some players will remain in lane while others
          will begin to roam around the map to help destroy other turrets or contest dragons or Rift Herald, which are
          objectives that will be covered soon.</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Late game (after 30 minutes)</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mid game usually ends and around the 30 minute mark when all of the first turrets in the lanes are
          destroyed (sometimes even more are gone by then). This is the late game.</p>
        <p>At this point, champions have acquired many of their major items and teams begin to group for large
          teamfights around Baron and Elder Dragons.</p>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <img src="images/scoreboardinked.png" width="900" height="400" />
        <p>The picture above shows the ingame scoreboard that shows everything you need to know during the game.</p>
        <p>It can look quite complicated at first, but we will just be focussing on the top part of the scoreboard.</p>
        <div class="towers">
          <img src="images/turret.png" id="turretref" height="70" width="300" />
          <p>The white area shows the number of structures that your team have destroyed.</p>
          <img src="images/tower.png" height="400" width="300" />
          <img src="images/inhibitor.png" id="inhib" height="300" width="300" />
        </div>
        <br>


        <div class="dragons">
          <img src="images/dragonref.jpg" id="dragonref" wdith="100" />
          <p>The red area shows the number of dragons that your team have slayed. (Allied team: Left, Enemy team: Right)
          </p>
          <p>Since dragons require quite a bit of explaining, you can watch this video to gain a basic understanding of
            this objective.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xVbnRdvONA" title="YouTube video player"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>Basically, The first dragon will always appear at 5:00 in every LoL match. But if you slay it in 7:55 for
            example, the next dragon will spawn at 13:55.</p>
          <p>There is no way of controlling which dragon is going to spawn next in LoL. You can only check which drake
            will be next either in the logo on the dragon pit or when you press “TAB”.</p>
          <br>

        </div>
        <div class="soul">
          <p>The orange area represents the current dragon soul. When it lights up, it shows the type of dragon soul
            that your team currently has.</p>
          <p>If your team collects 4 dragon buffs (no matter the combination), you'll get the dragon Soul buff of the
            third dragon’s type (right to left).</p>
          <p>The Soul is a powerful permanent buff that often determines whether you'll win the game or not.</p>
          <p>If you want to know more about what each dragon soul does, <a
              href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/all-league-of-legends-buffs-baron-chemtech-hextech-dragons-1742106/">check
              out this article!</a></p>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="baron">
          <p>The purple area represents the timer for when the Baron Nashor will spawn. (20 minutes)</p>
          <p>Baron is the most powerful monster in Summoner's Rift so you'll need multiple team members to slay it
            unless a match goes on for a very long time</p>
          <p>Killing the Baron grants the following buff:</p>
          <img src="images/nashor.png" width="200" height="200" />
          <img src="images/baronbuff.jpg" id="baronbuff" />
          <p>If you do not outright win by pushing with Baron minions, the enemy base will likely be destroyed enough to
            make your future attempts much easier.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="elder">
          <p>The yellow area represents the timer for when Elder Dragon will spawn (35:00 minutes or six minutes after
            the soul is taken.)</p>
          <img src="images/elder.jpg" height="300" />
          <img src="images/elderbuff.png" id="elderbuff" height="200" />
          <p>Once you are able to kill the elder dragon and get the Aspect of the Dragon's buff (Elder buff), it's
            pretty much game over.</p>
          <p>This buff basically instantly kills any enemy lower than 20% health, unless they become invulnerable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="herald">
          <p>One objective that was not included is the Rift Herald. The Rift Herald is a monster that resides in the
            Baron pit before Baron is slain, and spawns 8 minutes in.</p>
          <img src="images/riftherald.png" id="herald" width="640" height="380" />
          <img src="media/riftheraldcharge.gif" id="heraldcharge" />
          <p>The Herald is quite tanky so you may need multiple members of your team to kill it.</p>
          <p>A crucial tip to remember is that it has a weak spot on it's back that will inflict additional damage if
            you hit it.</p>
          <img src="images/heralddrop.png" id="heralddrop" width="400" height="200" />
          <p>After a team kills the Herald, a purple item, called Eye of the Herald (right), will drop that one allied
            team member can pick up</p>
          <p>The Eye of the Herald will remain in your inventory for 4 minutes and expire if not used.</p>
          <p>When used, the Eye will summon the Herald to fight for your team by attacking enemy structures until it
            dies. Refer to the gif attached</p>
          <p>Something more general to note is that the dragon pit and baron pit are 2 different locations. The baron
            pit is near top lane, and the dragon pit is near bot lane.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>5. What does gold do?</h4>
          <p>Gold is the in-game currency of League of Legends. It is used to buy items in the shop that provide
            champions with bonus stats and abilities, which in turn is one of the main ways for champions to increase
            their power over the course of a game.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of the game, champions are given 500 starting gold to buy items, and can receive more gold
            through various means.</p>
          <p>Since this is a beginners' guide, I will only be touching on the ways to earn gold and how to purchase
            items for your champion.</p>

          <h4>Minions and jungle monsters</h4>
          <p>Gold can be earned by dealing the killing blow ("last hit") to enemy minions and neutral monsters in the
            jungle. The gold earned from minion kills is dependent on the game time. As the game progresses, each minion
            is worth more, while jungle monsters award the same amount of gold.</p>
          <img src="media/cs.gif" id="csing" />
          <p>Certain monsters give gold globally, (Rift herald, Dragons, Baron) providing gold for the entire team. The
            champion who lands the killing blow receives additional gold.</p>

          <h4>Champions</h4>
          <p>Likewise, killing enemy champions and assisting in killing enemy champions also grant gold. A kill is 300
            gold, an assist is 150 gold, split amongst all the assistants.</p>
          <p>As you slay more and more enemies, you will be worth more gold if the enemy manages to slay you. This would
            reset once you are slain.
          <p>If you get slain repeatedly, you will be worth less gold to the enemy. This would reset if you slay an
            enemy.

          <h4>Turret and Turret platings</h4>
          <p>Damaging a tower decreases it's total heath pool, and when you destroy 1 plate from it, it rewards 175
            gold, split amongst teammates near the tower (local gold). Destroying a tower awards 50 gold to all
            teammates, and 250 local gold.</p>
          <img src="images/plating.png" id="plating" />
          <p>Do note that tower plates disappear 14 minutes into the game, so make sure to utilise the Rift herald to
            get as many tower plates as possible.</p>

          <h4>Spending gold</h4>
          <p>To spend your gold, you need to be at your spawn point and open up your shop menu (default hotkey is "P")
          </p>
          <img src="images/shop.png" id="shop" height="450" width="725" />
          <p>This guide isn't going to go too in depth on what items to buy as which champion, but you should always be
            spending your gold.</p>
          <p>Imagine you are in top lane and kill your lane opponent 1 time and dont spend the gold that you get from
            the kill. You decide to stay in lane. When your lane opponent comes back, he has spent his gold from killing
            minions to buy items and is going to come back even stronger than you.</p>
          <p>Thus by spending your gold, you maintain a lead against your opponents.</p>
