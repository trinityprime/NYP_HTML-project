        <h4>1. What <em>is</em> league of legends?</h4>
        <p>League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the others enemy nexus, nexus basically referring to the core, which when destroyed, ends the game.</p>
        <img src="images/mapnexus.jpg" height="500" width="1000"/>
        <p>Here is a map of the game, with blue side (blue circle) and red side (red circled) highlighted. At the start of the game, you and 4 other teammates will spawn at either nexus.</p>
        <p>In order to clear a path to the nexus, you will have to destroy the towers standing in you and your allies' way. Minions will spawn on both sides, which would help you destroy these towers and eventually the nexus as well. </p>
        <p>You begin at level 1 and gradually get stronger throughout the game by gaining experience and earning gold to buy items. 
        <p>Your team and the enemy team will continually grow in power and collide. Eventually, one team is able to get the upper hand and make a final push for a victory.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h4>2. How do I pilot my character?</h4>
        <p>Every champion has auto-attacks and abilities at their disposal. Auto-attacks, also known as “basic attacks” occur when a player right clicks on a target, continuing until it dies. Abilities are cast using Q, W, E, and R. Every champion has abilities that are unique to them for each of these buttons. Here is Xayahs ultimate "Featherstorm", in action below (left), as well as Aphelios using multiple abilites below (right)</p>

        <img src="media/xayahult.gif"/>
        <img src="media/aphel.gif" width="565" height="350"/>
        <p>A major aspect that sets champions apart is the distribution of their stats. Stats represent a champions make up as far as how hard they are to kill, how much damage they do, and how fast they move or attack.</p>
      
        <div class="stats"> 
        <img src="images/healthmana.jpeg" width="500" height="250" /> 
        <img src="images/levleip.jpg" width="500" height="250"/> 
        </div>

        
        <div>
        <p>In the image above, the yellow bar represents your own health, the blue bar your allies' health, and the red bar your enemies' health. Most champions have a mana bar (blue bar below the health bar) which can be replenished at the spawn point, as well as in battle (albeit more slowly)</p>
        <p>Different champions have different stats, and as you level up, you gain more health, mana, and can level up your abilities</p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <h4>3. Role assignments</h4>
        <p>In a standard game of League of Legends, each of the five players on a team is assigned to one of the five specific roles. The five roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC (Attack damage carry), and Support.</p>
        <p>Before a match, you have the opportunity to select a primary role which indicates the role youd prefer to play, as well as a secondary role which represents a backup choice.</p>    
        <img src="images/map2.png" height="500" width="800"/>
        <p>I will give a brief description of all 5 roles in league of legends, so see which one you prefer the most, or just go ahead and try them all!</p>

    <h4>4. What do I do during the game?</h4>
    <p>These concepts are leaning more towards being intermediate than beginner, but we want to quickly go over them since you will likely hear the terminology of the three phases: early game, mid game, and late game.</p>
    <p>The phases arent set in stone and act more as guidelines as every game is different in its own way, but they tend to hold true to regarding how the majority of games turn out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Early game (the first 15 minutes)</em></li>
    </ul>
        <p>This is when all the turrets are up and everyone is in their lane except for the junglers.</p>
        <p>Until the jungler arrives, top and mid will mostly be 1v1 and bot lane will mostly be 2v2.</p>
        <hr>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Mid game (15 to 30 minutes)</em></li>
    </ul>
        <p>At around 15 minutes, or when the first turrets begin to be destroyed, the mid game begins.</p>
        <p>During the mid game, a match becomes messier than lane phase as some players will remain in lane while others will begin to roam around the map to help destroy other turrets or contest dragons or Rift Herald, which are objectives that will be covered soon.</p>
        <hr>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Late game (after 30 minutes)</em></li>
    </ul>
        <p>The mid game usually ends and around the 30 minute mark when all of the first turrets in the lanes are destroyed (sometimes even more are gone by then). This is the late game.</p>
        <p>At this point, champions have acquired many of their major items and teams begin to group for large teamfights around Baron and Elder Dragons.</p>
   </ul>
</div>
    <div>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <img src="images/scoreboardinked.png" width="900" height="400"/>
    <p>The picture above shows the ingame scoreboard that shows everything you need to know during the game.</p>
    <p>It can look quite complicated at first, but we will just be focussing on the top part of the scoreboard.</p>
    <p class="towers">The white area shows the number of towers that your team have destroyed.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="dragons">
    <p>The red area shows the number of dragons that your team have slayed.</p>
    <p>Since dragons require quite a bit of explaining, you can watch this video to gain a basic understanding of this objective.</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-OF9qsh2yE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Basically, The first dragon will always appear at 5:00 in every LoL match. But if you slay it in 7:55 for example, the next dragon will spawn at 13:55.</p>
    <p>There’s no way of controlling which dragon is going to spawn next in LoL. You can only check which drake will be next either in the logo on the dragon pit or when you press “TAB”.</p>
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class="soul">
    <p>The orange area represents the current dragon soul. When it lights up, it shows the type of dragon soul that your team currently has.</p>
    <p>If your team collects 4 dragon buffs (no matter the combination), you’ll get the dragon Soul buff of the third dragon’s type (right to left).</p>
    <p>The Soul is a powerful permanent buff that often determines whether you’ll win the game or not.</p>
    <p>If you want to know more about what each dragon soul does, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/all-league-of-legends-buffs-baron-chemtech-hextech-dragons-1742106/">check out this article!</a></p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="baron">
    <p>The purple area represents the timer for when the Baron Nashor will spawn.</p>
    <p>Baron is the most powerful monster in Summoner’s Rift so you’ll need multiple team members to slay it unless a match goes on for a very long time</p>
    <p>Killing the Baron which spawns at 20 minutes grants the following buff:</p>
    <img src="images/baronbuff.jpg"/>
    <p>If you do not outright win by pushing with Baron minions, the enemy base will likely be destroyed enough to make your future attempts much easier.</p>
