        <h4>1. What <em>is</em> league of legends?</h4>
        <p>League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the others enemy nexus, nexus basically referring to the core, which when destroyed, ends the game.</p>
        <img src="images/mapnexus.jpg" height="500" width="1000"/>
        <p>Here is a map of the game, with blue side (blue circle) and red side (red circled) highlighted. At the start of the game, you and 4 other teammates will spawn at either nexus.</p>
        <p>In order to clear a path to the nexus, you will have to destroy the towers standing in you and your allies' way. Minions will spawn on both sides, which would help you destroy these towers and eventually the nexus as well. </p>
        <p>You begin at level 1 and gradually get stronger throughout the game by gaining experience and earning gold to buy items. 
        <p>Your team and the enemy team will continually grow in power and collide. Eventually, one team is able to get the upper hand and make a final push for a victory.</p>

        <h4>2. How do I pilot my character?</h4>
        <p>Every champion has auto-attacks and abilities at their disposal. Auto-attacks, also known as “basic attacks” occur when a player right clicks on a target, continuing until it dies. Abilities are cast using Q, W, E, and R. Every champion has abilities that are unique to them for each of these buttons. Here is Xayahs ultimate "Featherstorm", in action below:</p>

        <p>A major aspect that sets champions apart is the distribution of their stats. Stats represent a champions make up as far as how hard they are to kill, how much damage they do, and how fast they move or attack.</p>
      
        <div class="stats">

        <div>
        <p>In the image above, the yellow bar represents your own health, the blue bar your allies' health, and the red bar your enemies' health. Most champions have a mana bar (blue bar below the health bar) which can be replenished at the spawn point.</p>
        <p>Different champions have different stats, and as you level up, you gain more health, mana, and can level up your abilities</p>

        <h4>3. Role assignments</h4>
        <p>In a standard game of League of Legends, each of the five players on a team is assigned to one of the five specific roles. The five roles are Top, Jungle, Mid, ADC (Attack damage carry), and Support.</p>
        <p>Before a match, you have the opportunity to select a primary role which indicates the role youd prefer to play, as well as a secondary role which represents a backup choice.</p>    
        <img src="images/map2.png" height="500" width="800"/>
        <p>I will give a brief description of all 5 roles in league of legends, so see which one you prefer the most, or just go ahead and try them all!</p>
